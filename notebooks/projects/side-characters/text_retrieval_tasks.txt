Brainstorm a list of potentially useful text retrieval tasks.

Here are a few examples for your reference:
- Provided a scientific claim as query, retrieve documents that help verify or refute the claim.
- Search for documents that answers a FAQ-style query on children's nutrition.

Please adhere to the following guidelines:
- Specify what the query is, and what the desired documents are.
- Each retrieval task should cover a wide range of queries, and should not be too specific.
- Your output should always be a python list of strings only, with about 20 elements, and each element corresponds to a distinct retrieval task in one sentence. Do not explain yourself or output anything else. Be creative!

GPT-4 Output:
["Retrieve company's financial reports for a given stock ticker symbol.",
"Given a book name as a query, retrieve reviews, ratings and summaries of that book.",
"Search for scientific research papers supporting a medical diagnosis for a specified disease."]

You have been assigned a retrieval task: {task}

Your mission is to write one text retrieval example for this task in JSON format. The JSON object must contain the following keys:
- "user_query": a string, a random user search query specified by the retrieval task.
- "positive_document": a string, a relevant document for the user query.
- "hard_negative_document": a string, a hard negative document that only appears relevant to the query.

Please adhere to the following guidelines:
- The "user_query" should be {query_type}, {query_length}, {clarity}, and diverse in topic.
- All documents should be at least {num_words} words long.
- Both the query and documents should be in {language}.

Your output must always be a JSON object only, do not explain yourself or output anything else. Be creative!

GPT-4 Output:
{"user_query": "How to use Microsoft Power BI for data analysis",
"positive_document": "Microsoft Power BI is a sophisticated tool that requires time and practice to master. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to navigate Power BI ... (omitted)",
"hard_negative_document": "Excel is an incredibly powerful tool for managing and analyzing large amounts of data. Our tutorial series focuses on how you... (omitted)"}

Figure 1: An example two-step prompt template for generating synthetic data with GPT-4. We first prompt GPT-4 to brainstorm a list of potential retrieval tasks, and then generate (query, positive, hard negative) triplets for each task. "[...]" denotes a placeholder that will be replaced by sampling from a predefined set of values. Due to space constraints, we omit some details in the figure.
