# Stage Play Language Model Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a large language model (LLM) specifically for a stage play, containing four to twelve independent agents, each capable of understanding and generating dialogues and actions related to their roles.

### Goals

- Train a language model with four to twelve agents.
- Each agent should be able to accurately generate dialogues based on the plot and character backgrounds.
- Implement effective interactions between agents to support the unfolding of complex plots.

### Final Deliverables

- Autonomous performing agents.
- A complete deployment solution including backend model deployment and frontend interaction interface.

## Technical Requirements

### Software Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**: Primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow 2.x / PyTorch 1.8+**: For model training and inference.
- **Flask/Django**: For API development and deployment.
- **Docker**: For application packaging and deployment.

### Hardware Requirements

- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti or higher, at least 4 cards.
- **CPU**: Intel i7 or higher.
- **RAM**: At least 64GB.
- **Storage**: SSD at least 2TB.

### Dependency Libraries

- See `requirements.txt` for a list of all required Python libraries.

## Functional Requirements

### Agent Functions

- **Language Understanding**: Understand complex language inputs and respond.
- **Emotion Expression**: Express and understand emotions in dialogue.
- **Memory Ability**: Remember previous dialogues and actions.

### System Functions

- **User Interaction Interface**: A clean interface that allows users to interact and watch performances.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the performance of agents and the system.

## Security and Compliance

- Comply with GDPR and other data protection regulations.
- The system has security measures to prevent data leakage.

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Testing**: Test key functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure system components work together.
