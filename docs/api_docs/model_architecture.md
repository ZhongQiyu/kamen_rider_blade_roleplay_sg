# Model Architecture for Stage Play LLM

## Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of the model architecture used in our large language model (LLM) for stage play interactions. The LLM is designed to simulate four distinct agents, each responsible for a different aspect of the stage play. The architecture is built on top of transformer-based models, leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific roles in the play.

## Model Description

### Base Model

- **Model Type:** Transformer
- **Pre-trained Models Used:**
  - GPT-3 for generative tasks
  - BERT for understanding and classification tasks

### Agent-Specific Enhancements

#### Agent 1: Dialog Generator

- **Purpose:** Generates dialogues based on the current context of the play.
- **Architecture:**
  - Base: GPT-3
  - Modifications: Additional layers for emotional tone adjustment.

#### Agent 2: Context Analyzer

- **Purpose:** Analyzes the stage play's context to provide cues for other agents.
- **Architecture:**
  - Base: BERT
  - Modifications: Custom layers for extracting stage-specific context features.

#### Agent 3: Action Suggester

- **Purpose:** Suggests actions to actors based on the script and current dialogue.
- **Architecture:**
  - Base: GPT-3
  - Modifications: Integration with an external knowledge base about stage directions.

#### Agent 4: Audience Engagement Monitor

- **Purpose:** Monitors and reacts to audience engagement in real-time.
- **Architecture:**
  - Base: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
  - Modifications: Real-time analysis modules for sentiment analysis.

## Integration

- **Data Flow:** The agents receive inputs from both the live stage environment and pre-processed scripts. Outputs from each agent are fed into a central coordinator, which synthesizes responses and directs them back to the stage directions or dialogue generators.
- **APIs Used:** TensorFlow, PyTorch for model operations. Flask for creating a lightweight API for real-time interactions.

## Training and Fine-tuning

- **Training Data Sources:** Script data, historical play performances, audience feedback logs.
- **Fine-tuning Approach:** Each agent is fine-tuned using specific scenarios extracted from past plays, augmented with synthetic data generated to cover rare events.

## Performance Metrics

- **Evaluation Methods:** Each agent's performance is evaluated using a combination of scripted scenarios and live staged interactions in controlled environments.
- **Metrics:**
  - Dialogue quality (BLEU score, perplexity)
  - Context relevance (F1 score, accuracy)
  - Action appropriateness (human ratings)
  - Audience engagement levels (sentiment analysis results, engagement metrics)

## Conclusion

The multi-agent LLM architecture is designed to be robust and adaptive, capable of handling the dynamic nature of live stage plays. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI technology, the model aims to enhance the theatrical experience both for performers and audiences alike.
