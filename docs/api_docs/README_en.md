# Stage Play Multi-Agent Language Model Project

## Project Introduction

This project aims to develop a multi-agent large language model (LLM) that can interact specifically with a given stage play. The project includes four main agents, each capable of understanding and generating dialogue and actions relevant to their roles.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/stage-play-llm.git
```

Prepare the data:

Place related stage play data in the data/raw/ directory and run the preprocessing script

```bash
python scripts/preprocessing.py
```

Start the model training process:
```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

Fine-tune the model according to specific needs:
```bash
python scripts/finetune.py
```

Evaluate the model's performance:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
