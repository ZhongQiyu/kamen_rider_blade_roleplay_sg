    git clone https://github.com/your-repository/stage-play-llm.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Data preparation: Place the stage play related data in the `data/raw/` directory and run the preprocessing script:

    ```bash
    python scripts/preprocessing.py
    ```

4. Model training: Start the model training process:

    ```bash
    python scripts/train.py

# Kamen Rider Blade Multi-Agent System User Guide

## System Overview

This multi-agent system is based on the main characters from the Japanese tokusatsu series "Kamen Rider Blade". It aims to provide a versatile problem-solving and decision-support tool. The system includes four core agents, each simulating the characteristics and abilities of the characters in the series, to help users handle complex problems and situations.

## Agent Introduction

### Kazuma Kenzaki Agent

- **Main Function**: Decision-making and execution
- **Characteristics**: Brave, strong sense of justice, high adaptability
- **Use Case**: Situations requiring quick decisions and decisive actions

### Sakuya Tachibana Agent

- **Main Function**: Strategic analysis and risk assessment
- **Characteristics**: Calm, rational, cautious
- **Use Case**: Situations requiring detailed analysis and long-term planning

### Hajime Aikawa Agent

- **Main Function**: Information gathering and processing
- **Characteristics**: Sharp, observant, flexible
- **Use Case**: Situations requiring extensive information gathering and detailed insights

### Mutsuki Kamijo Agent

- **Main Function**: Support coordination and emotional analysis
- **Characteristics**: Gentle, empathetic, insightful
- **Use Case**: Situations involving interpersonal relationships and emotional factors

## System Usage

### System Initialization

```python
from blade_agents import BladeAgentSystem

system = BladeAgentSystem()
system.initialize()
```

### Setting Problems or Tasks

```python
problem = "How to improve internal communication efficiency in the company?"
system.set_task(problem)
```

### Activating Agents and Getting Feedback

```python
# Decision by Kazuma Kenzaki Agent
decision = system.activate_agent("kazuki")
print("Kazuma's Decision:", decision)

# Analysis by Sakuya Tachibana Agent
analysis = system.activate_agent("tachibana")
print("Sakuya's Analysis:", analysis)

# Information by Hajime Aikawa Agent
intel = system.activate_agent("aikawa")
print("Hajime's Information:", intel)

# Coordination suggestion by Mutsuki Kamijo Agent
coordination = system.activate_agent("mutsuki")
print("Mutsuki's Coordination Suggestion:", coordination)
```

### Comprehensive Analysis

```python
final_solution = system.synthesize_solutions()
print("Final Solution:", final_solution)
```

## Application Scenarios

### Project Management

```python
system.set_task("How to optimize the progress of a software development project?")
```

### Market Strategy

```python
system.set_task("What kind of marketing strategy should be adopted to promote a new product?")
```

### Crisis Management

```python
system.set_task("How should the company handle a public relations crisis?")
```

### Team Building

```python
system.set_task("How to improve team cohesion and work efficiency?")
```

## Notes

- Each agent provides suggestions based on a specific perspective.
- Final decisions should consider all outputs.
- System suggestions are for reference only; actual execution should be based on specific circumstances.
- Regularly update the system's knowledge base to ensure agents provide the latest and most relevant suggestions.
- For highly confidential or important decisions, it is recommended to combine the opinions of human experts.

## Customization and Expansion

### Adjusting Agent Parameters

```python
system.customize_agent("kazuki", risk_tolerance=0.8)
system.customize_agent("tachibana", analysis_depth="high")
```

### Adding New Functions

```python
system.add_new_capability("aikawa", "social_media_analysis")
```

### Creating New Agents

```python
system.create_new_agent("hirose", role="technical_expert")
```

## Troubleshooting

If the system is slow or results are abnormal, try the following steps:

- Reinitialize the system
- Ensure the problem description is clear and specific
- Adjust agent parameters
- Update the system knowledge base
- Contact the technical support team for help

## Conclusion

The Kamen Rider Blade Multi-Agent System provides a unique perspective on solving complex problems. By simulating the thinking patterns of different characters, it helps users comprehensively analyze problems and make more precise decisions. We hope this system becomes a powerful assistant in your work, bringing new ideas and inspiration. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact our support team. Enjoy using it!
