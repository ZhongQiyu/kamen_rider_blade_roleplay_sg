MultiModalProcessing Module
============================

The `MultiModalProcessing` module provides a unified interface for handling multiple data modalities and tasks. It is designed to facilitate the integration of various data types such as audio, text, and more, allowing seamless processing across different machine learning tasks.

Key Functionalities:
---------------------
1. **Audio Feature Extraction & Classification**
   - Extracts relevant features from audio data and performs classification based on the extracted features.
   - Supports multiple audio formats and customizable feature extraction pipelines.
  
2. **Text Style Classification & Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - Offers robust text processing tools for classifying text styles and identifying named entities within text.
   - Supports multi-language processing, with pre-trained models available for common languages.

3. **Question-Answer Pair Validation & Processing**
   - Provides tools to validate and process QA pairs, ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the data.
   - Capable of handling large datasets, with optimization for speed and efficiency.

Usage Example:
--------------
```python
from your_module_name import MultiModalProcessing

# Initialize the processing model
model = MultiModalProcessing()

# Train a sound classifier
audio_paths = ["path/to/audio1.wav", "path/to/audio2.wav"]
labels = [0, 1]  # Example labels for the audio files
sound_classifier = model.train_sound_classifier(audio_paths, labels)

# Perform text style classification
text = "Example text to classify"
style_result = model.style_classification(text)

# Train a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model
texts = ["Example sentence one.", "Example sentence two."]
labels = [[("Example", "Entity1")], [("sentence", "Entity2")]]
num_labels = 2  # Number of entity types
ner_model = model.train_ner_model(texts, labels, num_labels)

# Process question-answer pairs
base_questions_and_answers = [("What is AI?", "AI is..."), ("How does AI work?", "AI works by...")]
processed_qa_pairs = model.process_qa_pairs(base_questions_and_answers)
